# Job Stats

* After finishing school I needed a way to stay organized when job hunting. I found myself using pen and paper, excel and my memory to keep track of what companies and people I have reached out to. Instead I decided to create a simple application where I can input the companies I have applied to and people I have emailed. This helps me stay organized while also calculating response rate. At the same time this was a good exercise to keep sharp on my DOM manipulation and JavaScript.
